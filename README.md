<b>"Portfolyo Project"</b>

Hello 🌞 I would like to share my first project, the Portfolio project, which I completed with the training and mentorship of our instructor Murat Yücedağ within M&Y Yazılım Eğitim Akademi Danışmanlık
In this project, we went beyond the classic CV view and created a dynamic-based Portfolio&CV site.

💡 Users can add all their information dynamically.

💻 Add/Delete/Update/List features were added to the Admin Panel.

🥮 Data obtained using Column Chart and Statistics were visualized.

📎 CV download links, in-page redirects and social media redirects were added.
💕 A message leaving feature was created for site visitors via the Communication panel.

©️ ASP.Net MVC Framework based

🔎 Entity Framework was used as an ORM tool.

💯 DB First Approach was applied.

✔️ CRUD operations were applied.

🚀 LINQ queries were added.

📚 Database was created with MSSQL Server.

🔨 PartialView, Paging structure, data retrieval operations from DropDownList were implemented.

🌕 Data was converted to a chart using ChartJs Plugin.
